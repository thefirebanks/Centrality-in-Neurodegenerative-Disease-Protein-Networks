# Centrality-in-Neurodegenerative-Disease-Protein-Networks
Analyzing centrality of nodes in a protein-protein interaction network of neurodegenerative diseases to find their relatedness

- Main paper to replicate: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3914352/

### Next steps:

- Try new centrality measure, "Network Depth": https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.05060.pdf 
- Construct new relatedness measure
